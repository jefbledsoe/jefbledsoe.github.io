## About me

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I am amid a switch to the tech field. I am transitioning from a long and distinguished career in logistics managagement. I look forward to learning and working with people in this industry as we all transition into this new world with machine learning and A.I. I plan to use my skills in full stack development to help further and be a part of this new technical wave of A.I and machine learning, advocate for and contribute to U.S. political and voter literacy as well as develop web based and other games.
